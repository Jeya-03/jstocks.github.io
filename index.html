        <h2>Stock market</h2>
        <p>A stock market is not a place you can visit, it refers to the trading (some physical, most online) of shares that represent partial ownership of companies. It is not only a place where companies raise capital, but it is also used as a sign of the health of the economy.</p>

        <h2>How Stock Market Works?</h2>
        <p>A stock market is a large and complex business network where shares of companies are bought and sold and protected by law against fraud and other unfair business practices. It plays a vital role in the modern economy because it allows money to flow between investors and businesses.Sometimes the best way to see how something works is to look at its parts. In this light, we look at the most important elements of the stock market, from companies selling shares to stock exchanges to indexes that give us an overview of the state of the stock market.</p>

        <h2>Stocks?</h2>
        <p>When you buy a stock, you get a part of that company. How much of the company you own depends on the number of shares issued by the company and the number of shares you own. In the case of a small limited company, one share can represent a large part of the company. Large public companies often have millions, even billions, of shares. For example, Apple Inc. (AAPL) has billions of shares outstanding, so one share represents only a small part of the company.</p>
        <h2>Stock Exchange?</h2>
        <p>A stock exchange is a marketplace where people buy and sell shares of companies. Companies list their stocks (shares) on these exchanges to raise money. Investors can then trade these stocks, aiming to profit from price changes. Major stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ.
            <br>
            The stock exchange ensures trades are fair, transparent, and efficient, providing a regulated environment where buyers and sellers meet. It plays a vital role in the economy by allowing businesses to grow and individuals to invest in their future.
        </p>
        <h2>Difference Between Bonds and Commodities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Bonds:</b>They represent debt and are issued by governments and companies to raise capital. Investors buying bonds lend money to the issuer in exchange for interest payments and the return of the bond's face value at maturity.</li>
            <li><b>Commodities</b>There are 50 major trading markets in the world where you can buy commodities such as oil, steel, wheat and coal directly or buy futures contracts based on their price.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Investors and Traders</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Investors:</b>Generally, investors approach the market from a long-term perspective. They invest money in stocks, ETFs, mutual funds and other securities, expecting their value to increase over time; These are not the convenience stores you see in the movies to get in and out of quickly. These investors are often more concerned with the fundamental strength of the companies or assets they invest in, such as their financial performance, market position and growth potential. They decide on investments after research and analysis or after receiving recommendations from financial advisors, constantly seeking to build wealth through a portfolio that increases in value over time.</li>
            <li><b>Traders:</b>Traders focus on short-term gains in the stock market, capitalizing on market volatility by trading stocks, options, futures, and other financial instruments over periods from seconds to months. They often use technical analysis, studying market trends, charts, and statistics to predict price movements. While trading can yield quick profits, it carries higher risks compared to long-term investing. Successful trading requires a deep understanding of the market and an active, hands-on approach. Traders must swiftly buy and sell securities, adapting quickly to market changes to maximize their returns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Determination of Stock Prices</h2>
        <p>Stock prices are determined by supply and demand in the market. When more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), the price goes up. Conversely, if more people want to sell a stock than buy it, the price goes down. Factors influencing this include company performance, economic conditions, news, and investor sentiment. Stock exchanges use an auction system where buyers bid a price theyâ€™re willing to pay, and sellers ask a price theyâ€™re willing to accept. When these prices match, a trade occurs, setting the stock's price. This dynamic process continues throughout the trading day.</p>
        <h2>Working Of Indian Stock Market</h2>
        <p>The Indian stock market operates through two primary exchanges: the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Companies list their shares on these exchanges to raise capital. Investors buy and sell shares through brokers, with trades executed electronically. Stock prices are determined by supply and demand, influenced by company performance, economic indicators, and global events. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates the market to ensure transparency and protect investors. Trading occurs during specified hours on business days, with indices like the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty tracking overall market performance.</p>
        <h2>Use of AI in Indian Stock Market Prediction</h2>
        <p>AI is increasingly used in the Indian stock market for prediction and trading. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast amounts of data, including historical prices, financial reports, news, and social media trends, to identify patterns and predict stock movements. AI models can process this data faster and more accurately than humans, providing insights for making informed trading decisions. High-frequency trading algorithms use AI to execute trades at lightning speeds, capitalizing on small price changes. AI also helps in risk management by forecasting market volatility. Overall, AI enhances efficiency, precision, and profitability in the Indian stock market.</p>
